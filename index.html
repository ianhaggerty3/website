          <div id="senior_design" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Senior Design</h2>
            <p>
              I completed my senior design project in the Fall of 2020.
              The project was "Social Distancing Chess," a chess board which enables remote, manual chess play on a physical board between two players.
              Check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDki9iu0yV0 ">Demo Video</a>.
              Our on-board source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ECE-477-Team-22-Fall-2020/src">here</a>.
              Note that this does not include the board-specific libraries.
              There is also a <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Archive/2020/Fall/477grp22/index.html">Project Website</a>, but the archive needs to be fixed for the site to display properly.

          <div id="competitions" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Competitions</h2>
            <p>
               I have competed in four competitions during my undergraduate years, and had my best performance in the Spring of 2021.

               <h2>Terminal Midwest Regional 2021</h2>
               <p>
                 Terminal is an AI Programming Competition hosted by Correlation One.
                 This was my third time competing in it, and it was hosted virtually.
                 There is a global competition that you can try out on <a href="https://terminal.c1games.com/">their website</a>, and also host student competitions with variants of the current season's game rules.
                 <br><br>
                 I teamed up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-x-cao-71016656/">Phillip Zao</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shilin-shirley-ma-939b6a57/">Shilin Ma</a> to craft an adaptive, tower-defense style Python algorithm.
                 We managed a 9th place finish out of 47 in a stacked competition field, earning $1,000.
                 <a href="https://terminal.c1games.com/watch/7939555">Here</a> is one of the matches from our final algorithm (Note: You need to have a Terminal account to view the replay).
               </p>

               <h2>HackIN 2020</h2>
               <p>
                 HackIN 202 is a Virtual hacking event hosted by the Indiana Innovation Institute.
                 One competition focus was on reverse engineering. 
                 The competition tasked student teams with solving a variety of challenges mostly corresponding to different binary files.
                 <br><br>
                 I teamed up with two electrical engineers from Purdue Fort Wayne, and we were able to take 9th place out of around 30 teams.
                 This was a very exciting competition for me, because I had dedicated a lot of time over the summer to learning about different binary reverse engineering tools.
                 I had learned about the subject when taking ECE 404: Introduction to Computer Security.
                 After that, I completed most of <a href="https://maxkersten.nl/binary-analysis-course/">Max Kersten's Binary Analysis course</a>.
                 I saw the competition as a cool way for me to show off these new skills.
                 I used Ghidra for most of the challenges, and had a great time coming up with solutions.
               </p>

               <h2>Terminal UIUC Vs. Michigan 2020</h2>
               <p>
                 This was another Terminal student competition which ocurred virtually in Fall 2020.
                 I entered this competition with my roommate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-maclean-741023158/">Matthew MacLean</a>.
                 We came up with a lot of cool ideas to compete with our opponents, but couldn't make it out of the first round.
                 We were able to open-source our strategy at this <a href="https://github.com/ianhaggerty3/boiler_up_c1_games">repo</a>.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Terminal UIUC Vs. Michigan 2019</h2>
               <p>
                 This was my first Terminal competition, and it took place physically at UIUC in Fall 2019.
                 I joined a team with two UIUC students, and we completed the competition within the course of a day.
                 We were unable to make it past the first round, but it was very fun to meet and interact with so many other students in similar majors.
                 There were very few Purdue students there, so I was able to meet a lot of new people.
               </p>
